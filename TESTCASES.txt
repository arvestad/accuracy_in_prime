1. Sequence length and DNA/AA

Vary the sequence length and sequence type to determine how it affects inference.
Lengths: 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1000

2. Errors in simple tree

Partly based on the performance in the Test 1, we decide on one single
sequence length.

In the simple tree, the main clades are single leaves. The 'normal' host tree is
   H1 = (A, (B, (X, (C, D))))
where X is first of all moved at different distances between B and (C, D).

The second test is that X is moved to the wrong side of X and (C, D).

3. Errors in medium tree

Here we change the clades to contain two leaves:
     H2 = ((A1, A2), ((B1, B2), ((X1, X2), ((C1, C2), (D1, D2)))))
