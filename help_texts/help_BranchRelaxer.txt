BranchRelaxer is part of the JPrIME-GenPhyloData suite of tools for creating
realistic phylogenetic data. BranchRelaxer takes a Newick tree with
branch lengths (often ultrametric times) and creates a replica of the tree
with relaxed (non-clock like) branch lengths by applying rates drawn from a
probability distribution or similarly. The tree must have at least two leaves.

Usage:
    java -jar jprime-X.Y.Z.jar BranchRelaxer [options] <tree> <model> <arg1> <arg2> <...>
Required arguments:
     <Tree file or tree string> <Model> <Model arg 1> <Model arg 2> ...
Options:
-h, --help
     Display help. Default: false.
-o, --output-file
     Output relaxed tree to a file. Also writes used model parameters to a file
     named <filename>.info.
-s, --seed
     PRNG seed. Default: Random seed.
-x, --auxiliary-tags
     Include auxiliary PrIME tags in output tree. Default: false.
-innms, --keep-interior-names
     Keep interior vertex names in outpout tree. These are otherwise cleared.
     Default: false.
-min, --min-rate
     Minimum rate allowed. Default: 1e-64.
-max, --max-rate
     maximum rate allowed. Default: 1e64.
-a, --max-attempts
     Maximum number of attempts at creating random rates that meets
     requirements. If not met, no tree is output. Default: 10000.
Supported models:
    Constant <rate>                 -  Constant rates (i.e., strict molecular clock).
    IIDGamma <k> <theta>            -  IID rates from Gamma(k, theta).
    IIDLogNormal <mu> <sigma2>      -  IID rates from ln N(mu, sigma^2).
    IIDNormal <mu> <sigma2>         -  IID rates from N(mu, sigma^2).
    IIDUniform <a> <b>              -  IID rates from Unif([a,b]).
    IIDExponential <lambda>         -  IID rates from Exp(lambda).
    IIDSamplesFromFile <filename>   -  IID rates drawn uniformly (with replacement)
                                       from a file with a column of samples.
    ACTK98 <start rate> <v>         -  Autocorrelated lognormal rates in accordance w.
                                       Thorne-Kishino '98 but corrected
                                       to not yield increasing average rates
                                       in root-to-leaf direction.
    ACRY07 <start rate> <sigma2>    -  Autocorrelated lognormal rate in accordance w.
                                       Rannala-Yang '07. The start rate refers to
                                       tip of tree in case there is a stem edge.
    ACABY02 <start rate>            -  Autocorrelated exponential rates in accordance w.
                                       Aris-Brosou-Yang '02.
    ACLBPL07 <start rate> <mu> <theta> <sigma>
                                    -  Autocorrelated CIR rates in accordance w.
                                       Lepage-Bryant-Phillipe-Lartillot '07. The
                                       process is simulated using a discretisation
                                       across every branch. The start rate refers to
                                       tip of tree in case there is a stem edge.
    IIDRK11 <host tree> <guest-to-host map> <scale factor>
                                    -  IID gamma rates governed by host tree in
                                       accordance w. Rasmussen-Kellis '11.
                                       Every guest branch rate is created from a gamma
                                       distribution specific for each host edge the
                                       branch passes over. The scale factor is then
                                       applied to all relaxed lengths. Parameters are
                                       stored in the host tree thus:
                                       (A:0.4[&&PRIME PARAMS=(<k>,<theta>)],...
                                       Guest and host tree must be temporally compatible
                                       and have no lateral transfer events.
