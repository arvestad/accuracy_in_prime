================================================================================
GuestTreeGen is part of the JPrIME-GenPhyloData suite of tools for creating
realistic phylogenetic data. GuestTreeGen takes a Newick "host" tree with
ultrametric branch lengths and generates a "guest" tree evolving inside the
host tree. This is achieved through a canonical extension of a birth-death
process, in which guest tree lineages may be duplicated, lost, or laterally
transferred (i.e., be split with one copy being transferred to a contemporaneous
host edge). Guest lineages branch deterministically at host tree vertices.
Auxiliary files detailing the process are also created by default.

It is now also possible to generate gene trees over hybrid graphs. This is
covered in more detail in the online tutorial.

Usage:
    java -jar jprime-X.Y.Z.jar GuestTreeGen [options] <host tree> <dup rate> <loss rate> <trans rate> <out prefix>
Required arguments:
     <host tree file or string> <dup rate> <loss rate> <trans rate> <out prefix>
Options:
-h, --help
     Display help. Default: false.
-q, --quiet
     Suppress creation of auxiliary files and write only pruned tree directly to
     stdout. Default: false.
-s, --seed
     PRNG seed. Default: Random seed.
-n, --no-of-guest-trees
     Number of guest trees to generate. Default: 1.
-min, --min-leaves
     Minimum number of extant guest leaves required. Default: 2.
-max, --max-leaves
     Maximum number of extant guest leaves allowed. Default: 64.
-minper, --min-leaves-per-host-leaf
     Minimum number of extant guest leaves per host leaf required. Default: 0.
-maxper, --max-leaves-per-host-leaf
     Maximum number of extant guest leaves per host leaf allowed. Default: 10.
-sizes, --leaf-sizes-file
     Samples the desired number of extant leaves uniformly from a single-column
     file. This is suitable for mimicking a known leaf size distribution.
     Default: No sampling.
-nox, --no-auxiliary-tags
     Exclude auxiliary PrIME tags in output trees and suppress creation of files
     for the mappings. Default: false.
-p, --leaf-sampling-probability
     Governs the probability of observing a guest tree leaf. Lineages that fail
     to be observed will be pruned away similarly to lineages lost during the
     evolutionary process. Default: 1.0.
-mpr, --enforce-most-parsimonious-reconciliation
     Requires the pruned guest tree to not have any duplication vertex that
     occurs on a host edge other than what a most-parsimonious reconciliation of
     the pruned guest tree topology would suggest, and that cannot be mistaken
     for a speciation. Default: false.
-a, --max-attempts
     Maximum number of attempts at creating random tree that meets requirements.
     If not met, no tree is output. Default: 10000.
-stem, --override-host-stem
     If set, overrides the stem edge of the host tree by the specified value. If
     no stem edge is desired, this can be set to 0. Default: Value in host tree.
-vp, --vertex-prefix
     Vertex prefix. Default: G.
-vph, --vertex-prefix-host-map
     Append host vertex/edge belonging to vertex prefix. Default: true.
-hybrid, --hybrid-host-graph
     <post-hyb timespan> <post-hyb dup fact> <post-hyb loss fact>. Assumes that
     the input host tree is in fact a hybrid DAG. The transfer rate parameter
     will be ignored (i.e., set to 0). The additional parameters refer to a
     change-factor applied to the parameters for a limited time following a
     hybrid speciation.
